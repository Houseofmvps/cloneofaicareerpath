The API calls are consistently timing out after 30 seconds, preventing new analysis creation. Consider: 1) Implementing async processing with status polling, 2) Optimizing Claude prompt to reduce response time, 3) Increasing timeout limits to 60-90 seconds, 4) Adding retry logic with exponential backoff.
